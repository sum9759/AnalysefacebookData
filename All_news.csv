"135","148746965181554","Connacht Tribune - Galway City Tribune","There are water restrictions in Carna/Kilkieran, Roundstone, Ros Muc, Carraroe and Laurencetown/Eyrecourt tonight due to unprecedented demand.
Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council is restricting water supply to the Carna/Kilkieran, Roundstone, and Rós Muc water supplies tonight from 10pm until 9am tomorrow morning as well as the Laurencetown and Eyrecourt zones of the Ballinasloe Regional Water Supply. Unprecedented demand due to taps being left running is causing reservoir levels to drop. We are appealing to customers to turn off taps and check for leaks on their own properties and in holiday homes and unoccupied premises and to report them to Irish Water’s customer care helpline on 1850 278 278.
 
The Carraroe water supply was restored to customers today following water restrictions on the scheme yesterday and overnight. The reservoirs have filled sufficiently to allow supply to return however, due to increased demand restrictions will be in place again tonight and for the next few nights until demand regularises and the water treatment plant can meet the demand needs. It may take several hours for all sections of the network to get water supply once it is restored again in the morning. Water supply to the village and the nursing home is being maintained at all times.
 
Irish Water is grateful to Galway Fire Service who delivered bottled water out to Carraroe yesterday evening on behalf of the utility and the local fire service distributed it to vulnerable customers.
 
Across Co Galway customers are being advised that due to the extremely cold weather conditions and exceptionally high water demand, water treatment plants are struggling to keep up with supply demands. 
 
Customers are being asked to conserve water to avoid reservoirs emptying and water pressure to homes and businesses being affected.
 
Night time restrictions on the Tully and Letterfrack supplies has enabled the reservoirs to refill to some degree and full supply has been restored this morning. Irish Water would like to thank customers supplied by these schemes for adhering to our water conservation notice yesterday. There will be further restrictions on this scheme tonight.
 
A repair crew travelled to Inishbofin this morning (Saturday) to carry out repairs to a mechanical fault at the plant. The plant is back in production with limited capacity. There will be water restrictions in place tonight. Customers on the island are urged to conserve water. Bottled water was delivered to the island today.
 
Williamstown is suffering a major water supply issue due to a leak in the town. Leak repair crews were unable to find the leak today. Supply will be rotated to customers in the area over the coming days and customers will experience intermittent disruptions and/or loss of supply.
 
In East Galway customers are again urged to conserve water by turning off taps in properties and farm buildings, not running dishwashers or washing machines where possible and taking showers instead of baths.
 
Irish Water is appealing to any customers with external taps to ensure that these are securely turned off as we try to protect the levels of our reservoirs and secure drinking water for local communities. A continuous flow from an external tap over a 24 hour period could use the equivalent of the daily water usage of 40 households.
 
The following areas are experiencing low pressure and/or loss of supply due to an increase in demand and some issues at treatment plants: Kilkerrin/Moylough, Mountbellew, Dunmore/Glenamaddy, Ahascragh, Williamstown and Tuam.
 
Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience this is causing and assures customers that repairs will be completed as soon as possible. Irish Water would also like to thank the local authority staff for their efforts in keeping water supplies running in very difficult conditions.
 
Once further information is available we will issue another update. Updates will also be posted to the supply and service section of Irish Water’s website at www.water.ie/water-supply/supply-and-service-update/","2018-03-03T20:19:09+0000","status",NA,"148746965181554_1696906523698916",NA,33,32,64

There are High Spring Tides at the moment- the highest was earlier on Saturday morning at 5.50am. The risk of over-topping in the Docks/Spanish Arch/Claddagh area & in Salthill was low. Galway City Council  crews were on-site on Saturday morning from 5am.

Roads into and through Galway Harbour were closed as a precaution as high tide came & went. Water levels were below quay walls. No over-topping or flooding occurred in the area or in Salthill.
Roads in the harbour were reopened following an uneventful high tide. 

Our intrepid Roads crews continue salting primary routes around city as they have done since 5 am. Caution still advised out & about.","2018-03-03T09:12:32+0000","status",NA,"148746965181554_1696376163751952",NA,28,1,4

I want to pay tribute today to our outstanding health service staff all over the country for their incredible dedication and commitment.

They are going to huge efforts to keep vital services open and ensure patients are looked after in very difficult conditions. From across Ireland I have heard stories today of health care workers walking to work, staying past their shifts, sleeping in hospitals overnight, and going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure their patients get the care they need.

I would also like to thank our paramedics for transporting patients in very difficult conditions, Civil Defence staff for helping deliver crucial medication and the Defence Forces for transferring dialysis patients and medicines, as well as helping our dedicated health staff to get to work safely.

Let us all support our committed health care staff by ensuring we keep emergencies for emergencies.

I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to people to check in on your vulnerable friends, relatives and neighbours, when it’s safe to do so, to make sure they are well and warm.""","2018-03-01T18:28:58+0000","status",NA,"148746965181554_1694706713918897",NA,449,36,66

Following the upgrade of the weather warning last night by Met Eireann to Status Red for the entire country today (Thursday March 1st), Galway University Hospitals (University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park University Hospital) and Portiuncula University Hospital have cancelled routine electives and outpatient appointments today and tomorrow (Friday 2nd).
 
The hospitals are putting arrangements in place to ensure the continuation of essential services for chemotherapy and dialysis patients as well as those coming in for urgent surgery. These patients are being prioritised at this time and are being contacted by the clinical teams in relation to appointments/procedures planned for today and tomorrow. In circumstances where patients are unable to travel, alternative dates will be provided as soon as possible.  
 
In relation to the renal service in Merlin Park, we are in contact with transport providers for dialysis patients with regard to the weather conditions. Patients will be contacted individually and decisions will be based on clinical need and the travel advice from the National Emergency Co-ordination Group.
 
We will continue to do everything possible to maintain all essential services to patients receiving planned cancer and renal services. All appointments cancelled during this period will be rescheduled and we will be in contact directly with patients to reschedule their appointments.
 
Patients should be advised that if they do attend the hospital today for a clinic appointment they will be seen.

Where possible, radiotherapy patients should attend for their scheduled treatment in UHG.
 
The hospitals’ Emergency Departments continues to be busy and we expect difficulties around discharge planning as a consequence of the adverse conditions.
We would ask that patients who are being discharged today are collected from the hospital as early as possible to avoid travelling during the worsening conditions forecast for this afternoon
 
We would encourage people to consider all options available to them for their healthcare needs and to protect the ED for those most seriously ill as delays can be expected.

On Saturday, 20th January, NUI Galway student David Higgins, of Tralee, and Alex McGourty of Calry, Co Sligo, lost their lives whilst kayaking the Abianco River, in the Macas Region, Ecuador. 

Kayaking was David and Alex's passion, and they spent their lives travelling and dreaming of challenges and experiences. Meeting new people and spreading a zest for life with everyone who was lucky to meet them.

They were  vibrant, kind souls who lived life to its full potential, and words cannot describe what they meant to their family and friends.

Now, it's time to bring them home one last time. To help David's and Alex's family do this, their friends have set up a GoFundMe page to gather funds to support their journey.

"720","148746965181554","Connacht Tribune - Galway City Tribune","MOUTH CANCER AWARENESS DAY
WEDNESDAY,  20 SEPTEMBER
Mouth cancer is an important global healthcare problem. There are more than 300 cases of cancer of the mouth (oral cavity and pharynx) reported in Ireland every year. These cancers are more common in men than in women. However this is changing.

The incidence rate of cancer of the mouth in women has increased significantly at a rate of 3% per year since 1994. It mainly affects older people although younger people are being diagnosed now. In Britain, the incidence of mouth cancer has increased faster than any other cancer in the past 25 years.

According to the National Cancer Registry in Ireland, roughly half of all mouth cancers and even less of cancers of the pharynx are diagnosed at an early stage.

This can result in more complex treatment with greater impact on quality of life and overall survival. Whilst it depends on the cancer site we know that more than half of those treated will have good survival outcomes and this continues to improve each year.

Early detection of mouth cancer greatly improves the chances of survival.

Dentists have a key role to play in the early detection of mouth cancer and in the prevention of the disease by identifying those patients who are exposed to risk factors.

Mouth Cancer Awareness Day is Wednesday, 20 September 2017

Please consult your dentist during your routine dental visit about a mouth cancer examination - taking 10 minutes that could save your life.","2017-09-18T08:26:57+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/ConnachtTribune/photos/a.154527567936827.36001.148746965181554/1538772342845669/?type=3","148746965181554_1538772796178957",NA,19,1,14

"979","323864916940","The Galway Advertiser","Galway United return to action at Eamonn Deacy Park tonight (Friday) when the Tribesmen face Cabinteely. Kick-off is at 7.45pm at the Corribside venue.

Friday's league encounter will be the first competitive meeting of the two sides.

Cabinteely have lost both of their opening league games by a single goal against Wexford and Cobh Ramblers.

United meanwhile were held by UCD last week, drawing 1-1, after recording a convincing 4-1 win against Athlone Town on the first night of the season and Shane Keegan is targeting another league win at Eamonn Deacy Park against Pat Devlin's side.

Keegan warns about complacency — 

""The thing that I was hammering home to the players is, Cabinteely are a team that have lacked the rub of the green over their two opening games, rather than playing poorly in them.

""It makes them dangerous opposition for us, they're desperate to get points on the board. That bit of luck that might've alluded them is possibly due to swing around soon, so it really is important that our player don't think that we're facing a team who are struggling. We've got to be at our best, or it will be a serious banana skin for us.

""When you have aspirations of trying to win this division or attain promotion, realistically you're looking to try and win every home game. You're going into your home games with a level of expectation of delivering a performance and the three points.

""Hopefully the Cabinteely game will be no different. If we can get a regular big crowd behind us at home, it's definitely a big help to us.

""We gave our supporters four goals in our last home game and even if it wasn't our greatest performance, hopefully the vast majority of them will return for the Cabinteely game and if we can deliver once again, winning becomes a habit.""

TEAM NEWS
Robbie Williams is rated as 50/50 for the Cabinteely game, the experienced English defender missed last week's trip to the UCD Bowl with a calf problem.

Conor Melody has returned to training following a knee injury and he may be included in United's match day squad for the first time this season.

In order to assist staff in curtailing the spread of this virus, it is imperative that only essential visiting takes place in St Mary’s ward, St Anthony’s ward and St Enda’s ward during this period.
 
Children should not visit the hospital as they may be particularly susceptible to the illness.
 
We are asking that visitors are requested to cooperate with hospital staff who are ensuring the restrictions are adhered to and visitors are also advised that they must use the alcohol hand gels supplied as they enter and leave the hospital. Infection control procedures are in place on the affected wards and will remain so until further notice.
 
There continues to be an increase in the number of cases of Norovirus in the community and anyone with recent symptoms of diarrhoea and/or vomiting or who has had contact with others who have these symptoms should not visit patients in the hospital to avoid spreading the virus to sick vulnerable patients.
 
The Emergency Department at University Hospital Galway continues to be extremely busy and we apologise that patients are experiencing delays.

"1059","323864916940","The Galway Advertiser","Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council would like to advise customers on the following public water supplies that restrictions will be in place again tonight to allow reservoirs replenish and to ensure water supply tomorrow: Tully, Letterfrack, Tír an Fhia, Carraroe (supply being maintained in the village and to the nursing home), Williamstown, Moylough, Rós Muc, Clonbur/Cornamona, Eyrecourt, Laurencetown, Kiltormer and Clonfert.
 
Restrictions to water supplies are necessary where demand is outstripping supply so reservoirs have the opportunity to replenish over night and therefore ensuring customers receive a water supply during the day.
 
Customers are being asked to conserve water by turning off taps, both inside and outside, limiting usage of washing machines and dishwashers where possible and taking showers instead of baths, to avoid reservoirs emptying and water pressure to homes and businesses being affected.
 
Approximately 4,000 customers in the Eyrecourt, Laurencetown, Kiltormer and Clonfert areas will be without a water supply today and tomorrow (Wednesday). Consumption has increased by 50 per cent in this area and customers are urged to conserve water in every way possible. Water supply will be maintained to Ballinasloe town and Portiuncula Hospital.
 
Alternative water supplies will be available in Eyrecourt, Laurencetown, Clonfert and Kiltormer and bottled water will be distributed to vulnerable customers who have self-registered with Irish Water.
 
There will be two tankers in the Square, Eyrecourt this afternoon.
There will be one tanker each at the Community Hall Laurencetown, Clonfert Church and Kiltormer Church from 6pm.
Kiltormer Nursing Home will also be attended to.
Bottled water was delivered to Eyrecourt, Kiltormer and Laurencetown this afternoon.
 
Irish Water makes every effort to ensure that the alternative drinking water supply provided, including the tanker/bowser, and dispensing tap, are adequately disinfected. However, as it is not practical to provide sterilised containers for the public to transport drinking water from the tanker to their homes and we cannot guarantee that any containers used by the public do not negatively impact or contaminate the drinking water. Therefore people are advised to boil this water before use.
In Carraroe night time restrictions will continue over the coming days. This will be managed locally to ensure water supply is rotated around the scheme.
 
Restrictions will continue over the coming days in Tully and Letterfrack, but supply will be on for the full daytime period and the situation is improving.
 
Some customers are receiving intermittent supply in Tír an Fhia due to excessive demand. Restrictions will continue over the coming days. Bottled water will be delivered to customers who are without any supply in high lying areas tomorrow (Wednesday) and to vulnerable customers who have self-registered with Irish Water.
 
Restrictions will be in place in Rós Muc and Moylough again tonight due to excessive demand on the scheme.  
 
Leak repairs are still being undertaken in Williamstown. High leakage on customers’ properties is also being addressed. Supply will continue to be rotated to customers in the area over the coming days and customers will experience intermittent disruptions and/or loss of supply.
  
Across Galway there are issues with high demand. Irish Water is appealing to customers to turn off taps and check for leaks on their own properties and in holiday homes and unoccupied premises and to report them to Irish Water’s customer care helpline on 1850 278 278. Irish Water is appealing to any customers with external taps to ensure that these are securely turned off as we try to protect the levels of our reservoirs and secure drinking water for local communities. A continuous flow from an external tap over a 24 hour period could use the equivalent of the daily water usage of 40 households.
  
Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience this is causing and assures customers that repairs will be completed as soon as possible. Irish Water would also like to thank the local authority staff for their heroic efforts in keeping water supplies running in very difficult conditions.

"1072","323864916940","The Galway Advertiser","Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council will be assessing water supply schemes across the county today to monitor usage levels which will inform decisions about which supplies need to be restricted overnight. By restricting schemes where demand is outstripping supply, reservoirs have the opportunity to replenish over night and therefore ensuring customers receive a water supply during the day.
 
Customers are being asked to conserve water by turning off taps, both inside and outside, limiting usage of washing machines and dishwashers where possible and taking showers instead of baths, to avoid reservoirs emptying and water pressure to homes and businesses being affected.
 
In Carraroe night time restrictions will continue over the coming days. This will be managed locally to ensure water supply is rotated around the scheme. Irish Water would like to thank Galway Fire Brigade and the local fire service for distributing bottled water to vulnerable customers in Carraroe who have registered with Irish Water.
 
A repair crew returned to Inishbofin this morning (Sunday) to carry out further repairs to a mechanical fault at the plant. The plant is in production with limited capacity. There will be water restrictions in place tonight. Customers on the island are urged to conserve water. Bottled water was delivered to the island yesterday.
 
Demand has increased significantly once again on the Tully and Letterfrack supplies and last night’s restrictions will continue until this afternoon to allow the reservoirs refill. There will be more restrictions on this scheme tonight.
 
Customers in Tir an Fhia are receiving intermittent supply due to issues at the water treatment plant. There will be further restrictions on this supply as a result. Repairs are currently being carried out at the plant. Customers are urged to conserve water as much as possible.
 
Night time restrictions were imposed on the Carna/Kilkieran, Roundstone, and Rós Muc water supplies last night from 10pm until 9am this morning. Unprecedented demand due to taps being left running is causing reservoir levels to drop. This scheme will be monitored throughout the day and a decision on further restrictions will be taken this evening.
 
Leak repair crews are still trying to find a leak in Williamstown which is causing a major water supply issue in the town. Supply will be rotated to customers in the area over the coming days and customers will experience intermittent disruptions and/or loss of supply.
 
Across Galway there are issues with high demand. Irish Water is appealing to customers to turn off taps and check for leaks on their own properties and in holiday homes and unoccupied premises and to report them to Irish Water’s customer care helpline on 1850 278 278.

A continuous flow from an external tap over a 24 hour period could use the equivalent of the daily water usage of 40 households.
 
The following areas are experiencing low pressure and/or loss of supply due to an increase in demand and some issues at treatment plants: Kilkerrin/Moylough, Mountbellew, Dunmore/Glenamaddy, Ahascragh, Ballinasloe and Tuam.
 
Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience this is causing and assures customers that repairs will be completed as soon as possible.

"1087","323864916940","The Galway Advertiser","Galway City Council's Severe Weather Assessment and Response Team has met each day this week to assess the current and forecasted situation regarding the current snow and ice warnings and other weather related issues.
The Coordination Group reconvened this evening and received reports. 
There is a status Orange warning Snow/Ice that applies to Galway City currently in place and up to 9.00am on Saturday, 3rd March. Snowfall continues across the city. Salting of national, regional and the main routes across the city will take place between 5.00 am and 10.00am on Saturday morning. Galway City Council continues to have an ample supply (and reserve stock) of salt.
City Council staff will continue to be deployed as long as it it is safe for them to be outdoors.
We're working closely with Cope Galway in relation to getting rough sleepers into our Cold Weather service in the Westside. If anyone is aware of rough sleepers who may need a bed, please contact Cope at 1800 788887 or 085 8009641 (9pm+)
Emergency calls for City Council regarding essential services can be made to 091 536400. On-call staff are responding to emergencies as they arise and if they can be deployed safely.
City Hall, Leisureland and the City Museum and recreation centres across the city will remain closed on Saturday. Druid Theatre company's performances of Waiting For Godot in the Town Hall Theatre at 2pm and 8pm on Saturday will go ahead. 
Galway City Council's advice to motorists, pedestrians and the public in general is to only undertake journeys if absolutely necessary,  no matter how short.
High Tides: the OPW issued a high tide advisory notice for the period of Thurs. 1st Mar. to Mon. 5th March. Galway City Council are aware of the current period of very high astronomical spring tides. The highest astronomical tide in this period will occur on Saturday morning at 5.50am. The assessment at the moment is that the risk of over-topping in the Docks/Spanish Arch/Claddagh area and in Salthill is low. City Council crews will be on-site on Saturday morning from 5am and may close roads should any overtopping occur.
The Infrastructure section will monitor tide levels and keep in contact with the Harbour Master during this period of high astronomical spring tides. The Aquadam bund at Fishmarket will be partially inflated and roads crews will be on standby (for road closures etc.) in the event of overtopping/flooding due to tides. 
Galway City Council remains in constant contact with the National Emergency Coordination Group and with other service providers including An Gárda Síochána, Civil Defence and the Fire Service locally. The Coordination Group in Galway City Council will reconvene on Saturday while staff and crews remain on standby to respond to issues as they arise during the day.
Members of the public are reminded of the advice regarding unnecessary journeys. Caution is advised on footpaths and streets as snow and ice will continue to be present.

Customers in Galway urged to turn off taps while supplies deplete due to unprecedented demand
 
Irish Water is advising customers in Carraroe that due to exceptionally high water demand and ongoing mechanical issues at the water treatment plant restrictions to water supply will continue unbroken until tomorrow morning. Water supply to the village and the nursing home is being maintained. It is intended to restore water supply to all areas in the morning.
 
Last night Irish Water, working in partnership with Galway County Council, was able to lift the restrictions for a couple of hours to allow water storage tanks in attics refill. However, reservoirs have not sufficiently filled today to enable a repeat of that tonight.
 
We are grateful to Galway Fire Service who delivered bottled water out to Carraroe this evening on behalf of Irish Water and the local fire service will distribute it to vulnerable customers. A further update will issue tomorrow.
 
Across Co Galway customers are being advised that due to the extremely cold weather conditions and exceptionally high water demand, water treatment plants are struggling to keep up with supply demands. 
 
Customers are being asked to conserve water to avoid reservoirs emptying and water pressure to homes and businesses being affected.
 
Customers in Tír an Fhia were without water this morning however, water supply was restored shortly after lunch.
 
There is huge demand being registered on the Tully and Letterfrack water supplies due to taps being left running in people’s homes and on farms. Irish Water is urging customers to conserve water. Restrictions will be in place on these schemes from 10am today until 6pm with supply due to be restored at 6pm for a couple of hours. Water will be restricted again overnight to fill the reservoirs.
 
Water levels on Inishbofin are very low following a mechanical failure at the water treatment plant. A repair crew will travel to the island tomorrow morning (Saturday) to carry out repairs. Customers on the island are urged to conserve water. Bottled water will be ferried to the island tomorrow and available to the public for collection at Inishbofin pier from 12.30pm.
 
In East Galway customers are again urged to conserve water by not running taps, taking showers instead of baths and to refrain from using dishwashers and washing machines.
 
The following areas are experiencing low pressure and/or loss of supply due to an increase in demand and some issues at treatment plants: Kilkerrin/Moylough, Mountbellew, Dunmore/Glenamaddy, Ahascragh, Williamstown and Tuam.
 
Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience this is causing and assures customers that repairs will be completed as soon as possible. 
 
Once further information is available we will issue another update. Updates will also be posted to the supply and service section of Irish Water’s website at www.water.ie/water-supply/supply-and-service-update/","2018-03-02T19:46:30+0000","link","http://www.water.ie/water-supply/supply-and-service-update/","323864916940_10156299767111941",NA,4,1,2

"1122","323864916940","The Galway Advertiser","Water supply under pressure in areas of Galway due to increased demand and water treatment plant issues
 
Irish Water is advising customers in Co Galway that due to the extremely cold weather conditions and exceptionally high water demand, water treatment plants are struggling to keep up with supply demands. 
 
Customers are being asked to conserve water to avoid reservoirs emptying and water pressure to homes and businesses being affected.
 
In Carraroe restrictions were imposed yesterday due to high demand and mechanical issues at the water treatment plant. Supply was restored to customers for two hours last night to allow attic storage tanks to refill and the restrictions are once again in place. Supply to the village and the nursing home is being maintained.
 
Customers in Tír an Fhia are without water since 5am this morning. A mechanical fault at the treatment plant will be repaired once it is safe for crews to attend the site.
 
There is huge demand being registered on the Tully and Letterfrack water supplies due to taps being left running in people’s homes. Irish Water is urging customers to conserve water. Restrictions will be in place on these schemes from 10am today until 6pm with supply due to be restored at 6pm for a couple of hours. Water will be restricted again overnight to fill the reservoirs.
 
Water levels on Inishbofin are very low following a mechanical failure at the water treatment plant. A repair crew will travel to the island as soon as possible to carry out repairs. Customers on the island are urged to conserve water.
 
In Galway east customers are again urged to conserve water by not running taps, taking showers instead of baths and to refrain from using dishwashers and washing machines.
 
The following areas are experiencing low pressure and/or loss of supply due to an increase in demand and some issues at treatment plants: Kilkerrin/Moylough, Mountbellew, Dunmore/Glenamaddy, Ahascragh and Williamstown.
 
Irish Water working in partnership with Galway County Council would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience this is causing and assures customers that repairs will be completed as soon as possible. 
 
Once further information is available we will issue another update. Updates will also be posted to the supply and service section of Irish Water’s website at www.water.ie/water-supply/supply-and-service-update/","2018-03-02T13:56:24+0000","link","http://www.water.ie/water-supply/supply-and-service-update/","323864916940_10156298731871941",NA,19,11,13

We apologise for any inconvenience to customers but road conditions will have to be assessed and safety is our priority.
 
Given the reduced weather warning for Connacht, and parts of the West and Northwest, we may be able to operate some services in less affected areas tomorrow.
However, this is very much subject to local road conditions and the level of treatment undertaken.
 
We will review this situation in the morning and provide further information around midday with a view to a possible resumption of some services in the late afternoon or evening.

These patients are being prioritised at this time and are being contacted by the clinical teams in relation to appointments/procedures planned for today and tomorrow. In circumstances where patients are unable to travel, alternative dates will be provided as soon as possible.  
 
In relation to the renal service in Merlin Park, we are in contact with transport providers for dialysis patients with regard to the weather conditions. Patients will be contacted individually and decisions will be based on clinical need and the travel advice from the National Emergency Co-ordination Group.
 
We will continue to do everything possible to maintain all essential services to patients receiving planned cancer and renal services. All appointments cancelled during this period will be rescheduled and we will be in contact directly with patients to reschedule their appointments.
 
Patients should be advised that if they do attend the hospital today for a clinic appointment they will be seen.
 
The hospitals’ Emergency Departments continues to be busy and we expect difficulties around discharge planning as a consequence of the adverse conditions.
We would ask that patients who are being discharged today are collected from the hospital as early as possible to avoid travelling during the worsening conditions forecast for this afternoon
 
We would encourage people to consider all options available to them for their healthcare needs and to protect the ED for those most seriously ill as delays can be expected.
 
GUH and PUH are working closely with colleagues in the Community Health Organisations and with the National Ambulance Service.

"1180","323864916940","The Galway Advertiser","Galway City Council’s Weather Assessment and Response Team has met each day this week to assess the current and forecasted situation regarding the current snow and ice warnings and other weather related issues. The Team met again on Wednesday afternoon with members of the Senior Management Team of GCC in attendance. An assessment of the current situation follows along with the actions being undertaken by City Council staff.
 
Weather
There are 2 weather warnings (www.met.ie)  in place that apply to Galway City:
·          A Status Yellow warning for snow ice for Connacht valid 8am Wed. 28th Feb. to 12noon on Thurs 1st Mar.  
·         A Status Orange warning for snow ice for Connacht valid 8pm on Thurs. 1st Mar. to 12noon on 12 noon on Fri. 2nd Mar. This warns of persistent snow showers in this period which together with strong easterly winds may lead to snow drifts.
 
The 2 Status Red warnings in place do not apply to Galway.
 
Weather Assessment
 
Severe Weather (Ice/Snow)
·         5 -day rainfall and temperature forecasts were assessed (www.met.ie).
·         Temperatures are expected to fall below 0 (freezing) in coming days with temperatures expected to fall as low as -4 degrees on the morning of Thurs. 1st Mar.
·         Light precipitation is forecast from evening of Wed. 28th Feb.  increasing to light-medium by morning of Fri. 2nd Mar. Coupled with low temperatures this precipitation will most likely be snow.  
 
High Tides
·         The OPW issued a high tide advisory notice for the period of Thurs. 1st Mar. to Mon. 5th Mar.
·         Galway City Council are aware of the period of the current period of very high astronomical spring tides.
·         The highest astronomical tide in this period will occur on Sat. 3rd Mar. ’18 – accurate predicted water levels are not yet available for this date.
 
 
Actions/Measures in place:
 
·         The Winter Maintenance Programme for roads across the city is on-going. It is intended that salting operations will take place 7-9pm tonight and again at 5am tomorrow morning (Thurs. 1st Mar. ’18). The situation will be monitored for following days. Galway City council has an ample supply (and reserve stock) of salt.
·         Requests have come in for salting on roads in estates and carparks in churches (in advance of religious events at the weekend).  The Roads section will facilitate such requests as best as possible.
·         The main pedestrianised streets in the city centre will be salted on Thursday morning and the status of the streets will be monitored thereafter.
·         The roads section will monitor water levels and keep in contact with the Harbour Master during this period of high astronomical spring tides
·         The Aquadam bund at Fishmarket  will be partially inflated and roads crews will be on standby (for road closures etc.) in the event of overtopping/flooding due to tides particularly early on Saturday morning 3rd March.
·           A Follow Up Meeting of the Weather assessment Team is scheduled for 2.30pm on Thurs. 1st Mar. ‘18
 

For information, here is a description of each of the status warnings used by Met Éireann

STATUS YELLOW - Weather Alert - Be Aware

The concept behind YELLOW level weather alerts is to notify those who are at risk because of their location and/or activity, and to allow them to take preventative action. It is implicit that YELLOW level weather alerts are for weather conditions that do not pose an immediate threat to the general population, but only to those exposed to risk by nature of their location and/or activity.

STATUS ORANGE - Weather Warning - Be Prepared

This category of ORANGE level weather warnings is for weather conditions which have the capacity to impact significantly on people in the affected areas. The issue of an Orange level weather warning implies that all recipients in the affected areas should prepare themselves in an appropriate way for the anticipated conditions.

STATUS RED - Severe Weather Warning - Take Action

The issue of RED level severe weather warnings should be a comparatively rare event and implies that recipients take action to protect themselves and/or their properties; this could be by moving their families out of the danger zone temporarily; by staying indoors; or by other specific actions aimed at mitigating the effects of the weather conditions.","2018-02-28T21:54:00+0000","link","http://www.met.ie/","323864916940_10156293734411941",NA,11,0,10

"1281","323864916940","The Galway Advertiser","Final hours onboard for Solo Atlantic Rower Damian Browne

Solo Atlantic Rower Damian Browne is now only hours away from the Finish Line of the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.  His current ETA is 6.30pm Irish Time.  The former Leinster and Connacht Rugby star set off on his 4,800km crossing on Thursday, 14th December from the Canary Islands and will finish in Antigua.  The Solo Atlantic Rower has now been at sea with his boat Gulliver’s Travels for nine weeks.  
Damian has taken on the challenge as an extreme trial of his mental and physical strength.  As a solo rower there has been no support boat and no company for Damian, just himself and a boatload of food to sustain him on his journey.  He is also rowing in an effort to raise funds for his chosen charities MADRA Dog Rescue & Adoption, Médecins Sans Frontieres and the Strong Roots Foundation School Rwanda.
Two days ago, the 37-year-old - who has regularly been posting videos and updates along the way - admitted he was feeling the effects of life on the ocean as he entered the final 100 nautical miles.  ""Last three mornings have been the hardest of the journey,"" he said ""imagine it: alarm summons you from the only semi dry place on the boat, your bed.  You pull on soaking wet shorts, base layer and wet suit top and climb out into the craziness.  The ever present howling wind and raging seas (are) now joined by frequent squalls and arse sores back with vengeance. It won’t be sunrise for four hours .... ignore the pain, ignore the impulses trying to weaken your resolve and just f****ng row.""
No stranger to a test of self during his Rugby Career, Damian completed his first international physical and mental challenge in April 2016 when he ran the Marathon des Sables in the Moroccan Sahara.  This fulfilled a dream of his which was 12 years in the making.  He then set his sights on his next perilous venture.  Damian came upon the Talisker Whisky Challenge and discovered that more people have summited Everest and been into space than have successfully rowed the Atlantic Ocean.  His training for the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge began two years ago which included him rowing around the West Coast of Ireland.

Here you will also get a glimpse into his solo Atlantic Rowing journey to date.","2018-02-15T15:14:40+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/GalwayAdvertiser/photos/a.10150259308546941.346109.323864916940/10156251879561941/?type=3","323864916940_10156251880056941",NA,43,0,3
