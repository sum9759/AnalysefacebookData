"135","there are water restrictions in carna/kilkieran, roundstone, ros muc, carraroe and laurencetown/eyrecourt tonight due to unprecedented demand.
irish water working in partnership with galway county council is restricting water supply to the carna/kilkieran, roundstone, and rs muc water supplies tonight from 10pm until 9am tomorrow morning as well as the laurencetown and eyrecourt zones of the ballinasloe regional water supply. unprecedented demand due to taps being left running is causing reservoir levels to drop. we are appealing to customers to turn off taps and check for leaks on their own properties and in holiday homes and unoccupied premises and to report them to irish waters customer care helpline on 1850 278 278.
 
the carraroe water supply was restored to customers today following water restrictions on the scheme yesterday and overnight. the reservoirs have filled sufficiently to allow supply to return however, due to increased demand restrictions will be in place again tonight and for the next few nights until demand regularises and the water treatment plant can meet the demand needs. it may take several hours for all sections of the network to get water supply once it is restored again in the morning. water supply to the village and the nursing home is being maintained at all times.
 
irish water is grateful to galway fire service who delivered bottled water out to carraroe yesterday evening on behalf of the utility and the local fire service distributed it to vulnerable customers.
 
across co galway customers are being advised that due to the extremely cold weather conditions and exceptionally high water demand, water treatment plants are struggling to keep up with supply demands. 
 
customers are being asked to conserve water to avoid reservoirs emptying and water pressure to homes and businesses being affected.
 
night time restrictions on the tully and letterfrack supplies has enabled the reservoirs to refill to some degree and full supply has been restored this morning. irish water would like to thank customers supplied by these schemes for adhering to our water conservation notice yesterday. there will be further restrictions on this scheme tonight.
 
a repair crew travelled to inishbofin this morning (saturday) to carry out repairs to a mechanical fault at the plant. the plant is back in production with limited capacity. there will be water restrictions in place tonight. customers on the island are urged to conserve water. bottled water was delivered to the island today.
 
williamstown is suffering a major water supply issue due to a leak in the town. leak repair crews were unable to find the leak today. supply will be rotated to customers in the area over the coming days and customers will experience intermittent disruptions and/or loss of supply.
 
in east galway customers are again urged to conserve water by turning off taps in properties and farm buildings, not running dishwashers or washing machines where possible and taking showers instead of baths.
 
irish water is appealing to any customers with external taps to ensure that these are securely turned off as we try to protect the levels of our reservoirs and secure drinking water for local communities. a continuous flow from an external tap over a 24 hour period could use the equivalent of the daily water usage of 40 households.
 
the following areas are experiencing low pressure and/or loss of supply due to an increase in demand and some issues at treatment plants: kilkerrin/moylough, mountbellew, dunmore/glenamaddy, ahascragh, williamstown and tuam.
 
irish water working in partnership with galway county council would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience this is causing and assures customers that repairs will be completed as soon as possible. irish water would also like to thank the local authority staff for their efforts in keeping water supplies running in very difficult conditions.
 
once further information is available we will issue another update. updates will also be posted to the supply and service section of irish waters website at www.water.ie/water-supply/supply-and-service-update/",33,32,64

following the upgrade of the weather warning last night by met eireann to status red for the entire country today (thursday march 1st), galway university hospitals (university hospital galway and merlin park university hospital) and portiuncula university hospital have cancelled routine electives and outpatient appointments today and tomorrow (friday 2nd).
 
the hospitals are putting arrangements in place to ensure the continuation of essential services for chemotherapy and dialysis patients as well as those coming in for urgent surgery. these patients are being prioritised at this time and are being contacted by the clinical teams in relation to appointments/procedures planned for today and tomorrow. in circumstances where patients are unable to travel, alternative dates will be provided as soon as possible.  
 
in relation to the renal service in merlin park, we are in contact with transport providers for dialysis patients with regard to the weather conditions. patients will be contacted individually and decisions will be based on clinical need and the travel advice from the national emergency co-ordination group.
 
we will continue to do everything possible to maintain all essential services to patients receiving planned cancer and renal services. all appointments cancelled during this period will be rescheduled and we will be in contact directly with patients to reschedule their appointments.
 
patients should be advised that if they do attend the hospital today for a clinic appointment they will be seen.

where possible, radiotherapy patients should attend for their scheduled treatment in uhg.
 
the hospitals emergency departments continues to be busy and we expect difficulties around discharge planning as a consequence of the adverse conditions.
we would ask that patients who are being discharged today are collected from the hospital as early as possible to avoid travelling during the worsening conditions forecast for this afternoon
 
we would encourage people to consider all options available to them for their healthcare needs and to protect the ed for those most seriously ill as delays can be expected.

"720","mouth cancer awareness day
wednesday,  20 september
mouth cancer is an important global healthcare problem. there are more than 300 cases of cancer of the mouth (oral cavity and pharynx) reported in ireland every year. these cancers are more common in men than in women. however this is changing.

the incidence rate of cancer of the mouth in women has increased significantly at a rate of 3% per year since 1994. it mainly affects older people although younger people are being diagnosed now. in britain, the incidence of mouth cancer has increased faster than any other cancer in the past 25 years.

according to the national cancer registry in ireland, roughly half of all mouth cancers and even less of cancers of the pharynx are diagnosed at an early stage.

this can result in more complex treatment with greater impact on quality of life and overall survival. whilst it depends on the cancer site we know that more than half of those treated will have good survival outcomes and this continues to improve each year.

early detection of mouth cancer greatly improves the chances of survival.

dentists have a key role to play in the early detection of mouth cancer and in the prevention of the disease by identifying those patients who are exposed to risk factors.

mouth cancer awareness day is wednesday, 20 september 2017

please consult your dentist during your routine dental visit about a mouth cancer examination - taking 10 minutes that could save your life.",19,1,14
