"1","kayaking","help to bring the remains of david and alex home.

on saturday, 20th january, nui galway student david higgins, of tralee, and alex mcgourty of calry, co sligo, lost their lives whilst kayaking the abianco river, in the macas region, ecuador. 

kayaking was david and alex's passion, and they spent their lives travelling and dreaming of challenges and experiences. meeting new people and spreading a zest for life with everyone who was lucky to meet them.

they were  vibrant, kind souls who lived life to its full potential, and words cannot describe what they meant to their family and friends.

now, it's time to bring them home one last time. to help david's and alex's family do this, their friends have set up a gofundme page to gather funds to support their journey.

friday's league encounter will be the first competitive meeting of the two sides.

cabinteely have lost both of their opening league games by a single goal against wexford and cobh ramblers.

united meanwhile were held by ucd last week, drawing 1-1, after recording a convincing 4-1 win against athlone town on the first night of the season and shane keegan is targeting another league win at eamonn deacy park against pat devlin's side.

keegan warns about complacency  

""the thing that i was hammering home to the players is, cabinteely are a team that have lacked the rub of the green over their two opening games, rather than playing poorly in them.

""it makes them dangerous opposition for us, they're desperate to get points on the board. that bit of luck that might've alluded them is possibly due to swing around soon, so it really is important that our player don't think that we're facing a team who are struggling. we've got to be at our best, or it will be a serious banana skin for us.

""when you have aspirations of trying to win this division or attain promotion, realistically you're looking to try and win every home game. you're going into your home games with a level of expectation of delivering a performance and the three points.

""hopefully the cabinteely game will be no different. if we can get a regular big crowd behind us at home, it's definitely a big help to us.

""we gave our supporters four goals in our last home game and even if it wasn't our greatest performance, hopefully the vast majority of them will return for the cabinteely game and if we can deliver once again, winning becomes a habit.""

team news
robbie williams is rated as 50/50 for the cabinteely game, the experienced english defender missed last week's trip to the ucd bowl with a calf problem.

conor melody has returned to training following a knee injury and he may be included in united's match day squad for the first time this season.

solo atlantic rower damian browne is now only hours away from the finish line of the talisker whisky atlantic challenge.  his current eta is 6.30pm irish time.  the former leinster and connacht rugby star set off on his 4,800km crossing on thursday, 14th december from the canary islands and will finish in antigua.  the solo atlantic rower has now been at sea with his boat gullivers travels for nine weeks.  
damian has taken on the challenge as an extreme trial of his mental and physical strength.  as a solo rower there has been no support boat and no company for damian, just himself and a boatload of food to sustain him on his journey.  he is also rowing in an effort to raise funds for his chosen charities madra dog rescue & adoption, mdecins sans frontieres and the strong roots foundation school rwanda.
two days ago, the 37-year-old - who has regularly been posting videos and updates along the way - admitted he was feeling the effects of life on the ocean as he entered the final 100 nautical miles.  ""last three mornings have been the hardest of the journey,"" he said ""imagine it: alarm summons you from the only semi dry place on the boat, your bed.  you pull on soaking wet shorts, base layer and wet suit top and climb out into the craziness.  the ever present howling wind and raging seas (are) now joined by frequent squalls and arse sores back with vengeance. it wont be sunrise for four hours .... ignore the pain, ignore the impulses trying to weaken your resolve and just f****ng row.""
no stranger to a test of self during his rugby career, damian completed his first international physical and mental challenge in april 2016 when he ran the marathon des sables in the moroccan sahara.  this fulfilled a dream of his which was 12 years in the making.  he then set his sights on his next perilous venture.  damian came upon the talisker whisky challenge and discovered that more people have summited everest and been into space than have successfully rowed the atlantic ocean.  his training for the talisker whisky atlantic challenge began two years ago which included him rowing around the west coast of ireland.
